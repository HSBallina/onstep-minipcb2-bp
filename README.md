# OnStep MiniPCB Version 2 (rework)
This is a rework of the OnStep MiniPCB version 2 by [Howard Dutton](http://stellarjourney.com/)
# Background
I picked up a second hand Orion Sirius telescope mount a while back. It's more or less equivalent to the Sky-Watcher EQ-5 mount. It has motor control but lacks both goto and tracking I looked into ways of adding this to the mount. While there are commercial options available, they're quite expensive and can't be built into the mount.

OnStep is an open source telescope mount controller, originally developed and manitained by Howard Dutton. There are multiple variants of the hardware available. I opted for the MiniPCB2 since it's closest in dimentions to the original controller PCB in the Sirius mount. Unfortunately it's not a drop in replacement so I'm reworking it to fit, adding a breakout for the connectors.
